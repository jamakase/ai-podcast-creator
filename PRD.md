# Project Design Document: Automated B2B Sales Video Podcast Generation

## 1. Project Title

Automated B2B Sales Video Podcast Generation

## 2. Goal

To develop a semi-automated pipeline for creating engaging video podcasts focused on B2B sales strategies and techniques. The output will be suitable for a YouTube channel dedicated to enhancing B2B sales skills.

## 3. Scope

The project encompasses the following key stages:

*   **Content Sourcing:** Identifying and selecting high-quality books or texts on B2B sales.
*   **Text-to-Audio Conversion:** Utilizing AI tools (specifically mentioning Gemini's Audio Overview capabilities) to generate an audio summary/podcast from the selected text. This is analogous to the functionality of NotebookLM.
*   **Video Podcast Creation:** Employing HeyGen (labs.heygen.com/video-podcast) to produce a video podcast featuring two avatars and incorporating the PDF version of the source text.
*   **Orchestration (Conceptual):** Leveraging CrewAI for managing and coordinating the different agents or tasks within the workflow (referred to as "context7").

## 4. High-Level Plan / Workflow

1.  **Content Identification:**
    *   Manually or semi-automatically search for and select a relevant book or comprehensive text on B2B sales.
    *   Obtain the text in a digital format (preferably PDF or plain text).
2.  **Audio Generation:**
    *   Input the selected text into a Gemini-based system (or similar) capable of generating an "Audio Overview."
    *   Review and refine the generated audio for clarity, engagement, and accuracy.
3.  **Video Podcast Production:**
    *   Prepare the source text as a PDF, if not already in that format.
    *   Utilize HeyGen's video podcast creation tool:
        *   Configure two digital avatars.
        *   Upload the PDF text for integration into the video.
        *   Generate the video podcast.
    *   Review the output video for quality and synchronization.
4.  **Workflow Automation (CrewAI Integration):**
    *   Define CrewAI agents for each major step (e.g., Content Curator Agent, Audio Generation Agent, Video Production Agent).
    *   Develop tasks for each agent.
    *   Create a crew to orchestrate the agents and tasks for a streamlined process.

## 5. Tools & Technologies

*   **Content:** Books and articles on B2B Sales.
*   **Text-to-Audio:** Gemini (Audio Overview feature) / NotebookLM equivalent.
*   **Video Generation:** HeyGen (labs.heygen.com/video-podcast).
*   **Orchestration Framework:** CrewAI.
*   **Programming Language (for CrewAI):** Python.

## 6. Potential Challenges

*   **Content Quality & Copyright:** Ensuring sourced content is high-quality, relevant, and used in compliance with copyright laws.
*   **AI-Generated Audio Quality:** The naturalness and engagement level of the AI-generated audio might require significant refinement.
*   **Avatar & Video Synchronization:** Ensuring avatars in HeyGen are expressive and well-synced with the audio and text.
*   **Integration Complexity:** Integrating different tools and APIs (Gemini, HeyGen, CrewAI) might present technical hurdles.
*   **HeyGen API/Automation Limitations:** The extent to which HeyGen's video podcast creation can be automated via API is unknown and needs investigation. If manual steps are required, this will impact full automation.
*   **CrewAI Implementation:** Developing effective CrewAI agents and tasks requires careful design and iteration.

## 7. Next Steps

1.  **Research Content:** Identify an initial B2B sales book/text to use as a pilot.
2.  **Explore Gemini Audio Overview:** Investigate the specifics of using Gemini for text-to-audio podcast generation. Document its capabilities and limitations.
3.  **Test HeyGen:** Manually create a sample video podcast using HeyGen with a short text to understand its features, workflow, and output quality. Investigate automation possibilities.
4.  **Setup CrewAI Environment:** Install CrewAI and set up a basic project structure.
5.  **Develop Initial CrewAI Agents:** Start by defining agents for the initial, more straightforward parts of the workflow.
6.  **Refine PDR:** Update this document as more information is gathered during the initial exploration phases.
